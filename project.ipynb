    "## About the Software\n",
    "\n",
    "The software I found was a stock option modelling software that took advantage of the Black-Scholes model for pricing option contracts. For those who do not know, an option contract is known as a derivative of the underlying stock price, and they can be used to hedge against positions or to increase returns on positions. For the Black-Shcoles model (which is just one of several option pricing models), the price of the contract can be calculated from the following function:\n",

    "However, one of the most important factors in an options price is called Implied Volatility (IV). Many traders are more interested in knowing the IV of a certain option contract rather than the price itself because they know the latter is determined by the former, and determining what volatility level the option was priced at can uncover unique trading strategies. However, IV is the only input to the model that is not directly observable, so the model must be sovled for implied volatility.\n",

These rootfinding algorithms allows for efficient and fast startegies to finding an accurate estimate for IV.

    "Above is how the author implements Newton's method and secant method. As we can see this is pretty much classical Newton. However, the only thing that might be confusing is vega. Vega is a value associated with an option contract that tells how much the price of an option contract will change with a $1\\%$ change in implied volatility. So, essentially it is the the derivative of implied volotility with respect to option price. Because of this we can use vega as the derivative of IV for Newton's method. We can see that every iteration they call the Black-Scholes method to find the option value corresponding to the estimated implied volatility and then updates the implied volotility if the calculated option price is not within a given tolerance.\n",
